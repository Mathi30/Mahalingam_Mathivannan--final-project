          <strong>Greetings,</strong> <br />
          <br />
          My name is <strong> Mathi Mahalingam.</strong> I am a software
          engineer with 20 years of working experience in telecom, enterprise,
          wireless platform, mobile app development industries. I graduated from
          the <strong>University of Waterloo</strong> with a
          <strong>BASc, in electrical engineering </strong> in <strong>1997.</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          I enjoy contributing to the world by designing programs that are
          centralized around Engineering. As a self-motivated and curious
          individual, I am always looking for more opportunities to learn and
          broaden my skill set.

          Aside from my tech background, my passion towards sports has lead me
          to run a sports club. Club offer Soccer, Badminton, Basketball Track & Field and Chess. As a coach I enjoy coaching kids in soccer and track and
          field. I am also a proud board member of Minor Track Association of
